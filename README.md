A project on GitHub typically refers to a software application designed to automate and streamline the operations of a library. These projects aim to replace manual processes with an efficient digital system for managing books, members, and transactions.
Adding new books, updating book details (title, author, ISBN, genre), searching for books, and tracking their availability status.
Registering new members, updating member information, and managing their borrowing history.
Handling the issuance and return of books, tracking due dates, and managing overdue fines.
These projects can be implemented using databases like MySQL to store and retrieve data. They aim to improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility within a library setting.
